# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
# Split X and y into training and test sets, setting test_size equal to 20%, random_state to 42, and ensuring the target label proportions reflect that of the original dataset.
# Fit the knn model to the training data.
# Compute and print the model's accuracy for the test data.



# Solution
# Import the module

y = churn_df["churn"].values

# Split into training and test sets

# Fit the classifier to the training data
